# very_simple_web_application
A very simple web application that is both a training support for RoR newbies and a useful tool if you need to build a new web application quickly without expert knowledge of RoR.


## Objectives
This project was developped as self-client website. This project has two goals :

* Educationnal : help AV newbie working on a project that is accessible with limited knowledge
* Usefulness : anyone may deploy the application and customize it (www.isitix.com is such an example). As the application is not very sophisticated, getting up to speed is easy.
* Design driven by analytics  : we develop things based on statistics of websites that use the code

The project is roughly in line with skills presented in SAAS book (http://www.saasbook.info/).

## Release 0
Release 0 is built on skills taught in CS169-1. You only need to have Ruby on Rails basic skills to deploy and customize it. There are, maybe, 20 or 30 lines of code, including 1 jquery line.

## Release 1
We will build a Release 1 that roughly matches CS169-2 skills (oauth, i18n, performance and design pattern).

## Release 2
We may then develop a Release 2 that will add client-side functionality (bootstrap, angularjs).

This is only an indicative plan. The plan will be bent to improve statistics of web site. 

You may fork any release and choose a different direction depending on your goals and needs!

In the future, we may initiate projects to merge the best forks in a new version of the application (advanced git and merge skills)

##Â Legacy code, BDD, TDD
The initial project was developped by someone who  was(is) not very fluent in agile methodology. He forgot to write BDD, TDD test cases. So, you'll have to polish your legacy code skills (SAAS book ch 9).
